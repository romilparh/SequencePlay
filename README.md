# SequencePlay

This is a watchOS game which first shows a person the sequence 4 numbers should be in for some seconds and then the person has to choose the numbers by touching the screen serialwise to score. If the person builds wrong sequence, game is over and points earned are displayed.

The game gets harder after each sequence until the sequence is shown only for "30 seconds" whereas at the start, the sequence is shown for "1 minute and 30 seconds" which gradually decreases while the points increase.
